<p>1. For each strong entity type E. Create a new table. Include as its columns, 
  all the simple attributes and simple components of the composite attributes 
  of E. Identify the primary key and the alternate keys. Do not include any multi-valued 
  attribute as a key. If the only unique field of an entity is a multi-valued 
  attribute, introduce an artificial primary key field. </p>


<p>2. For each weak entity W that is associated with only one 1:1 identifying 
  owner relationship. Identify the table T of the owner entity type. Include as 
  columns of T, all the simple attributes and simple components of the composite 
  attributes of W. </p>

<p>3. For each weak entity W that is associated with a 1:N or M:N identifying 
  relationship, or participates in more than one relationship. Create a new table 
  T. Include as its columns, all the simple attributes and simple components of 
  the composite attributes of W. Form the primary key of T as follow: In the case 
  of a 1:N owner relationship, by including as a foreign key in T, the primary 
  key of the owner entity. The primary key of T is the combination of W's partial 
  key and the foreign key. In the case of a M:N owner relationship, by creating 
  a new column that will hold unique values. (In this case, the association between 
  the weak entity and its owner entity will be specified in Step 6.) </p>

<p>4. For each binary 1:1 relationship type R. Identify the tables S and T of 
  the participating entity types. Choose S (preferably the one with total participation). 
  Include as foreign key in S, the primary key of T. Include as Columns of S, 
  all the simple attributes and simple components of the composite attributes 
  of R. </p>

<p>5. For each binary 1:N relationship type R. Identify the table S (at the N-side) 
  and T of the participating entities. Include as a foreign key in S, the primary 
  key of T. Include as columns of S, all the simple attributes and simple components 
  of composite attributes of R. </p>

<p><font size="3">6. For each N-ary relationship (including binary N:M relationship) 
  type R. Create a new table T. Include as columns of T, all the simple attributes 
  and simple components of composite attributes of R. Include as foreign keys, 
  the primary keys of the participating (strong or weak) entity types. Specify 
  as the primary key of T, the list of foreign keys. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">7. For each multi-valued attribute A. Create a new table T. 
  Include as columns of T, the simple attribute or simple components of the attribute 
  A. In table T, include as foreign key, the primary key of the entity or relationship 
  type that has A. Specify as the primary key of T, the foreign key and the columns 
  corresponding to A. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">8. For each specialization with disjoint subclasses. Create 
  a new table Ti for each subclass Si. Include as columns of Ti, the simple attributes 
  and simple component attributes of the superclass. Include as columns of Ti, 
  the simple attributes and simple component attributes specific to Si. Identify 
  the primary key. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">9. For each specialization with overlapping subclasses. Create 
  a new table O for the superclass. Include as columns of O, the simple attributes 
  and the simple component attributes of the superclass. Identify its primary 
  key and alternate keys. Create a new table Ti for each subclass Si. Include 
  as columns of Ti, the simple attributes and simple component attributes specific 
  to Si. Include as a foreign key in Ti (to be part of the primary key of Ti), 
  the primary key of O. </font></p>
